Welcome to Lance Jordan solution to Collatz Conjecture
What is the Collatz Conjecture?
Take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1.
Repeat the process (which has been called 'Half Or Triple Plus One', or HOTPO[6]) indefinitely.
The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
This code will solve the highest number of steps given an integer and includes a timer function.
Larger numbers will save to json file for faster loading later.
